## Overview

This code was adapted from https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T008_query_pdb.html, which is a part of a series of wonderful tutorials described in this paper (https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0351-x). This code uses several handy tools namely:

pypdb Python package (Bioinformatics (2016), 1, 159-60; documentation)
biotite Python package (BMC Bioinformatics (2018), 19; documentation)
